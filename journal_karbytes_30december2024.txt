1. Rewrite the karbytes-created Pi approximation application such that the simulation runtime goes on indefinitely instead of only for a selected finite amount of time. 

2. Start the "(virtually) indefinite" runtime simulation which approximates the irrational number Pi using a modified version of the source code for the timer-based randomness simulator and animator (which plots one (apparently randomly placed in terms of x-axis and y-axis integer coordinates) pixel-sized dot on a square canvas per second of simulation runtime) before 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 29_DECEMBER_2024.

3. Take daily readings of the ongoing multi-day simulation generated by the aforementioned "indefinite" runtime Pi approxinator in the form of web page application user interface screenshots. Upload those screenshot files to a karbytes-created GitHub repository (as karbytes).
