31_DECEMBER_2024: The following section of this note (beneath the line consisting of three asterisks separated by a single space and with neither leading nor trailing spaces) was written on 29_DECEMBER_2024 and was merely written in order to help karbytes organize its cognitive resources (and other resources) in order to make an indefinitely-running simulation which generates second-by-second snapshots of a Monte Carlo dart-throwing simulation which approximates the value of Pi as a ratio of dots plotted inside of a circle and dots plotted on the square canvas in which that circle is inscribed overall. Three different versions of that application are available at the following Uniform Resource Locators (URL).

1. Rewrite the karbytes-created Pi approximation application such that the simulation runtime goes on indefinitely instead of only for a selected finite amount of time. 

2. Start the "(virtually) indefinite" runtime simulation which approximates the irrational number Pi using a modified version of the source code for the timer-based randomness simulator and animator (which plots one (apparently randomly placed in terms of x-axis and y-axis integer coordinates) pixel-sized dot on a square canvas per second of simulation runtime) before 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 29_DECEMBER_2024.

3. Take daily readings of the ongoing multi-day simulation generated by the aforementioned "indefinite" runtime Pi approxinator in the form of web page application user interface screenshots. Upload those screenshot files to a karbytes-created GitHub repository (as karbytes).
