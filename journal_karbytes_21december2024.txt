karbytes_0: "Education is the end and not just the means to some end (with respect to all of my endeavors). Education (particularly ongoing (for the remainder of one's lifespan) self-initiated learning (e.g. reading books, attending lectures, working on open source software projects, et cetera)), if sufficient (i.e. not too little to feel like mere token studying and while including the attainment of new insights and of skill improvement), basically "cures" any mental illness as far as I am concerned. I noticed that my insecurities and annoyances tend to be almost nonexistent when I am making sufficient progress towards my (lifelong and self-taught) education goals. By contrast, when I am not intellectually active in that manner, I feel that my life is essentially being wasted and treated more as a prison sentence and/or enslavement (to other humans) than a life I could honestly say is worthwhile to me to live."

karbytes_0: "No. I only have myself to live for because my worldview is somewhat (but not entirely) solipsistic. That does not mean that I think it is impossible for subjective experiences other than my own ever exist (and, for the sake of not getting into unpleasant conflicts with the 'non playable characters' (i.e. NPCs) which inhabit my environment, I pretend that such 'NPCs' each have their own uniquely-corresponding subjective experience streams which are just as vivid and imbued with sentience as my own). Instead, what I mean when I say that I am solipistic is that I operate with the imagined premise that I am literally the only sentient being within the universe I happen to inhabit (and that what I fundamentally am is pure consciousness rendering my entire universe essentially as software which I am the sole end user of). I believe that other of such instances of pure consciousness exist which also each render their own uniquely-corresponding universe projections (and that each of such consciousness instances is localized to its own boundlessly large expanse comprised of pure consciousness).
