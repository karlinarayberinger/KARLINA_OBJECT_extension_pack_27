karbytes_0: "Education is the end and not just the means to some end (with respect to all of my endeavors). Education (particularly ongoing (for the remainder of one's lifespan) self-initiated learning (e.g. reading books, attending lectures, working on open source software projects, et cetera)), if sufficient (i.e. not too little to feel like mere token studying and while including the attainment of new insights and of skill improvement), basically "cures" any mental illness as far as I am concerned. I noticed that my insecurities and annoyances tend to be almost nonexistent when I am making sufficient progress towards my (lifelong and self-taught) education goals. By contrast, when I am not intellectually active in that manner, I feel that my life is essentially being wasted and treated more as a prison sentence and/or enslavement (to other humans) than a life I could honestly say is worthwhile to me to live."

karbytes_1: "Don't you have someone other than yourself to live for?"

karbytes_0: "No. I only have myself to live for because my worldview is somewhat (but not entirely) solipsistic. That does not mean that I think it is impossible for subjective experiences other than my own ever exist (and, for the sake of not getting into unpleasant conflicts with the 'non playable characters' (i.e. NPCs) which inhabit my environment, I pretend that such 'NPCs' each have their own uniquely-corresponding subjective experience streams which are just as vivid and imbued with sentience as my own). Instead, what I mean when I say that I am solipistic is that I operate with the imagined premise that I am literally the only sentient being within the universe I happen to inhabit (and that what I fundamentally am is pure consciousness rendering my entire universe essentially as software which I am the sole end user of). I believe that other of such instances of pure consciousness exist (or always have the potential to exist) which also each render their own uniquely-corresponding universe projections (and that each of such consciousness instances is localized to its own boundlessly large expanse comprised of pure consciousness (and that such expanses do not ever appear to each other to overlap))."

karbytes_1: "Don't you have social obligations you are supposed to fulfill? Are you even employed? You seem to have more time on your hands than what is considered to be normal for the society you live in. In fact, you seem to have too much free time because you demonstrate what seems like an excessive degree of self-education and (unearned) physical and mental wellness. Normally, you would need to correspond with people other than yourself much more intensively than you seem to have in order to reap the mental and physical fitness gains you have. Who told you what to do with your life? More importantly, who has been giving you basic material necessities to survive and thrive as well as you have?"

karbytes_0: "At the moment I am unemployed (but I have been employed at various jobs in the past). During the past four years I have been mostly or solely reliant on my parents for material accomodations such as housing, food, and money (which they send me via PayPal regularly and which I use to pay for my personal expenses). If I suddenly become cut off from my parents' financial support (which I do not think is likely to happen), then I will go to nearby homeless shelters for food, shelter, and other basic comforts (which I do not expect to be very high-quality, abundant, nor generously bestowed upon me (because I am think I come across as an unabashedly elitist (and self-absorbed) snob instead of sufficently humble, downtrodden, uneducated, gregarious, sychophantic, and apolitical (which means that I think that homeless and/or 'under employed' people are generally treated as delinquents and wayward children by my encompassing society))) and make it my 'full-time job' during that situation to acquire financial assistance from governemnt social services and/or from jobs which I attempt to get hired at (such as cashiering or warehousing)."

karbytes_1: "That's not how the real world works. You cannot just work your way out of poverty without the right people's permission (and you are not considered to be the right person to grant you such permission). Instead, you need to settle for the fact that your bout of homelessness and/or under employment is effectively a prison sentence designed to prioritize people who are not homeless and who are not under employed (while you are deliberately made to feel deprived of the comfort, prestige, and esteem only those who are not homeless and not under-employed get to enjoy)."

karbytes_0: "Are you suggesting that, if I become homeless while underemployed, I should just settle for waiting for other people to rescue me while doing little other than sleep or loiter in public spaces or in homeless shelters?"

karbytes_1: "Yes, but you are not ever supposed to be a nuissance to those who are considered to be exempt from needing punishment (especially if those people drive cars, occupy residences, and routinely contribute to other people's material welfare (especially if those other people are minor (especially prepubescent) children or, to a less prioritized extent, 'vulnerable adults' deemed to be unfit to contribute to society and even to their own individual upkeep)). Those exempt from punishment are deserving of preferential treatment (by society and according to society) because only those people partake in lifestyles which effectively contribute to maintaining the economy and a sufficiently large population size and density (because populations which are too low in density tend to be harder to mass indoctrinate and control (and it is important that children are socialized to feel obliged to contribute to society in a particular manner which ultimately deprives them of ever having sufficient freedom to become as self-educated as you aspire to be))."

karbytes_0: "I find it bizarre that you think that society wants its future inhabitants to not be allowed to be as self-educated as I aspire to be. According to my education, I understand that human civilization has evolved significantly across many generations (while generally becoming increasingly humane, wealthy, educated, and technologically advanced as time elapses for those civilizations). Therefore, it makes sense to me that, eventually (especially now), society will idealize people being self-taught and self-soveriegn as I aspire to be (while as many essential jobs as possible are outsourced to robots so that humans can maximize their free time and quality of life (while aquiring income from some form of direct employment or indirectly from robots which pay the majority of a civilization's taxes)."
