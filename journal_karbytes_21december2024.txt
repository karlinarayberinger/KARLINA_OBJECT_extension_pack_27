karbytes_0: "Education is the end and not just the means to some end (with respect to all of my endeavors). Education (particularly ongoing (for the remainder of one's lifespan) self-initiated learning (e.g. reading books, attending lectures, working on open source software projects, et cetera)), if sufficient (i.e. not too little to feel like mere token studying and while including the attainment of new insights and of skill improvement), basically "cures" any mental illness as far as I am concerned. I noticed that my insecurities and annoyances tend to be almost nonexistent when I am making sufficient progress towards my (lifelong and self-taught) education goals. By contrast, when I am not intellectually active in that manner, I feel that my life is essentially being wasted and treated more as a prison sentence and/or enslavement (to other humans) than a life I could honestly say is worthwhile to me to live."

karbytes_1: "Don't you have someone other than yourself to live for?"

karbytes_0: "No. I only have myself to live for because my worldview is somewhat (but not entirely) solipsistic. That does not mean that I think it is impossible for subjective experiences other than my own ever exist (and, for the sake of not getting into unpleasant conflicts with the 'non playable characters' (i.e. NPCs) which inhabit my environment, I pretend that such 'NPCs' each have their own uniquely-corresponding subjective experience streams which are just as vivid and imbued with sentience as my own). Instead, what I mean when I say that I am solipistic is that I operate with the imagined premise that I am literally the only sentient being within the universe I happen to inhabit (and that what I fundamentally am is pure consciousness rendering my entire universe essentially as software which I am the sole end user of). I believe that other of such instances of pure consciousness exist (or always have the potential to exist) which also each render their own uniquely-corresponding universe projections (and that each of such consciousness instances is localized to its own boundlessly large expanse comprised of pure consciousness (and that such expanses do not ever appear to each other to overlap))."

karbytes_1: "Don't you have social obligations you are supposed to fulfill? Are you even employed? You seem to have more time on your hands than what is considered to be normal for the society you live in. In fact, you seem to have too much free time because you demonstrate what seems like an excessive degree of self-education and (unearned) physical and mental wellness. Normally, you would need to correspond with people other than yourself much more intensively than you seem to have in order to reap the mental and physical fitness gains you have. Who told you what to do with your life? More importantly, who has been giving you basic material necessities to survive and thrive as well as you have?"

karbytes_0: "At the moment I am unemployed (but I have been employed at various jobs in the past). During the past four years I have been mostly or solely reliant on my parents for material accomodations such as housing, food, and money (which they send me via PayPal regularly and which I use to pay for my personal expenses). If I suddenly become cut off from my parents' financial support (which I do not think is likely to happen), then I will go to nearby homeless shelters for food, shelter, and other basic comforts (which I do not expect to be very high-quality, abundant, nor generously bestowed upon me (because I am think I come across as an unabashedly elitist (and self-absorbed) snob instead of sufficently humble, downtrodden, uneducated, gregarious, sychophantic, and apolitical (which means that I think that homeless and/or 'under employed' people are generally treated as delinquents and wayward children by my encompassing society))) and make it my 'full-time job' during that situation to acquire financial assistance from governemnt social services and/or from jobs which I attempt to get hired at (such as cashiering or warehousing)."

karbytes_1: "That's not how the real world works. You cannot just work your way out of poverty without the right people's permission (and you are not considered to be the right person to grant you such permission). Instead, you need to settle for the fact that your bout of homelessness and/or under employment is effectively a prison sentence designed to prioritize people who are not homeless and who are not under employed (while you are deliberately made to feel deprived of the comfort, prestige, and esteem only those who are not homeless and not under-employed get to enjoy)."

karbytes_0: "Are you suggesting that, if I become homeless while underemployed, I should just settle for waiting for other people to rescue me while doing little other than sleep or loiter in public spaces or in homeless shelters?"
