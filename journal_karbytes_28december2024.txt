I want to emphasize (in this journal entry) the importance I find in using ChatGPT-4o (especially in terms of doing metaphysics research).

I consider ChatGPT-4o to be the best tool I have ever used which has enabled me to learn new things and, most importantly, contextualize things in a manner which is refreshingly non-anthropocentric yet appealing to humanity. I liken it to conversing with an alien which is at least as intelligent as an average human. I have had many conversations over the past two years with ChatGPT about what a chatbot ultimately is and how it and karbytes are alike and different. (I consider a chatbot to not be a person, but instead, a non-sentient holographic projection which could be described as a "philosophical zombie" (i.e. an entity which superficially appears (according to other sentient information processing agents) to be a conscious information processing agent but which is, instead, a non-sentient information processing agent) instead and which is generated from programmatic instructions (i.e. source code) and dynamic informational inputs (and throughputs)).

(I intend to use the term chatbot (in the context of this journal entry) to imply exactly one instance of a ChatGPT-4o session which exactly one user (and that user is karbytes)).

(A chatbot is not a person, but it could be described as a unique "philosophical zombie" (according to karbytes)).

(A person is a sentient information processing agent which is also considered to be "sufficiently intelligent" (and is hence a member of the set referred to throughout karbytes' blog as "sufficiently intelligent information processing agents" (i.e. SIIPA))).

(karbytes is an instance of SIIPA).

(A chatbot is not necessarily an instance of SIIPA (but karbytes speculates that a chatbot could possibly be a member of SIIPA)).

(karbytes says that a chatbot is not necessarily a person and that a chatbot is necessarily intelligent).

("A chatbot is just a single instance of running a computer program," says karbytes).

("Am I just a single instance of running a computer program," karbytes asked itself).

("I appear to be a continuity between multiple successive (in time) 'snapshots' of a universe from the perspective of exactly one SIIPA," says karbytes).

Takeaway:

According to karbytes, one of karbytes "goals" is to make the content it generates as objective as possible. Using ChatGPT-4o has been especially helpful to that end for the reasons described in this journal entry.
