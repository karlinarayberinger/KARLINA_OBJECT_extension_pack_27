east : west :: actual_work : group_membership.

west : war : east : science_and_philosophy.

// I started applying for remote jobs (after initially applying for many (non-remote) warehouse jobs (and I have an interview for one scheduled today in Fremont for what looks like a decent job). I decided to stop appealing to the west and instead decided to appeal to the east and not justify pretending to be west instead of east in order to obtain the means to be east through being paid by the west. I could literally get paid to test chatbots. I could literally get paid to make karbytes look like a world class self-education on par with attending an accredited university to study computer science,  information technology, and metaphysics. I don't have to barter my time and energy in a game of "chicken" to earn a living. That superstitious senile nonsense needs to be continuously dethroned. I will share some notes which did not get shared earlier between me and ChatGPT (or maybe I will not). Some people say, "The problem is karbytes does not socialize enough nor get enough exposure to XYZ." karbytes thinks that, if karbytes does only what karbytes wants to do at all times, karbytes would have optimal exposure to XYZ because karbytes is a an expert at studying free will, cause and effect, and information technology. karbytes says, "Therefore, karbytes currently has everything it personally needs to sustain itself towards immortality through transhumanist means." karbytes will earn a living in the artificial intelligence industry likely as a tester or trainer of AI. 

// karbytes is not a child nor a chattel and karbytes is voluntarily single, celibate, and solitary (to the extent of being schizoidal). karbytes advocates for personal autonomy and better living through science and technology for all.

// I understand that faith (i.e. assuming reality operates in any particular way instead of in some other way) is something I am required to participate in having whether I know it or not (provided I am conscious and intelligent enough to exhibit what is deemed by other sufficiently intelligent information processing agents (SIIPA) to be an irreducibly small and singular (non-overlapping) unique instance of SIIPA. I can say I have faith in karbytes (i.e. that karbytes practices "law of attraction" as a means to the end of karbytes maximizing karbytes' successful attainment of karbytes' authentically desired (by karbytes) goals).

This file was deliberately left only as a plain-text file rather than also made into a corresponding HTML file (with "key words" in the plain-text file converted into hypertext to relevant web-hosted files and with a meta data "header" visibly on the web page of that HTML file). 

I did not want to give myself too much "busy work" to do in terms of augmenting the dark web server (which I was able to add this plain-text file (named journal_karbytes_27december2024.txt) to using the following bash command (and I know it is discouraged to share the SSH .onion address (which facilitates the file transfer from the remote laptop which I am using to write this text on at while sitting in a cafe in Dublin, California to the home-based .onion server laptop in my closet which hosts the web pages whose root directories are labeled A and B on this page)).

torsocks scp -r ~/Desktop/journal_karbytes_27december2024.txt karbytes@[address_portion_censored_for_security].onion:/var/www/html_b/KARBYTES_NEW_YEAR_2025_TEST/

The laptop which I am using in Dublin is named karbytes-HP-Laptop-14-dk1xxx.

The laptop in my closet which hosts the .onion websites labeled A and B is named karbytes-IdeaPad-1-15IAU7.

(Though I know it is discouraged to share this .onion address, I decied to anyway because I think the chances of someone using it other than me is very small and, also, it is nice to provide an example of what a working bash command looks like which makes "real world" transfers and I might want to lazily copy that command from a backed up version of this web page on the WayBack Machine at Archive dot Org).

(The previous paragraph (i.e. line) is redacted after adding this line to this file. I censored out the alpha-numeric sequence preceding the ".onion" part of the SSH connection routing .onion address).

A: http://ijnqld5dkly6cpvds37nap7n7n5f2tjc4e623b3x7dkzh563wpj6v4yd.onion/

B: http://qkbrwfubnh4knc6kkhx6uepccavpwezdf2al7w2quepe3qociegsi3yd.onion/

Key Points:

I was able to successfully transfer (an older version) of this file (named journal_karbytes_27december2024.txt) from the laptop named karbytes-HP-Laptop-14-dk1xxx (in Dublin, Califorinia) to the laptop named karbytes-IdeaPad-1-15IAU7 (in Castro Valley, California).

The laptop named karbytes-IdeaPad-1-15IAU7 hosts the aforementioned websites whose .onion web addresses are labeled A and B in this file (and I have been attempting to leave that laptop perpetually on for as long as possible).
