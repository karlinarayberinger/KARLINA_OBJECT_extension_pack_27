The following set of instructions was copied from a conversation karbytes had with ChatGPT-4o output about how to install a program (on a desktop or laptop computer whose operating system is a distribution of Linux) which causes a cursor to jiggle periodically for an indefinitely large number of fixed-period cycles (which the program user inputs as a number of seconds).

keep-presence is a utility that moves the mouse or presses a key when it detects that you are away, preventing the system from going idle.

Installation:

Open a terminal.

Install via Snap:

[bash]

sudo snap install keep-presence

Usage:

Run the program with a specified idle time (e.g., 30 seconds):

[bash]

keep-presence --seconds 30

This command moves the mouse after 30 seconds of inactivity.
