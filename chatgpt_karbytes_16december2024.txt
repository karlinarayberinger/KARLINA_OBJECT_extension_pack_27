The United States does not currently have an active draft; instead, it relies on a volunteer military force. However, the Selective Service System requires registration for potential conscription in the event of a draft.
Drafting Age:

    Registration Requirement: Men aged 18 to 25 are required to register with the Selective Service within 30 days of their 18th birthday.
    Eligibility for Draft (if reinstated): Men aged 18 to 26 could be subject to a draft if Congress and the President approve it.

Exclusions and Exemptions (if a draft is reinstated):

Certain individuals may be exempted or deferred from conscription based on various criteria, including:

    Conscientious Objectors:
        Individuals with deeply held moral, ethical, or religious beliefs against war may qualify as conscientious objectors. They may be assigned to alternative service instead of combat roles.

    Physical or Mental Disability:
        Those with significant physical or mental disabilities that prevent them from serving are exempt.

    Dependent Family Members:
        Individuals who are the sole providers for dependents, such as single parents or caregivers, may qualify for deferment.

    Students:
        College students may have their service deferred until the end of the academic year.
        High school students may have their draft deferred until they graduate or turn 20, whichever comes first.

    Certain Occupations:
        Those in critical professions (e.g., medical personnel or others essential to the economy and national security) may qualify for deferment.

    Religious Ministers:
        Clergy actively practicing their religious duties may be exempt.

Groups Excluded from Registration:

    Women: Women are not required to register for the Selective Service.
    Non-U.S. Citizens: Certain groups, such as individuals on non-immigrant visas, are not required to register. However, permanent residents, refugees, and asylum seekers must register.
    Incarcerated Individuals: Those in prison are exempt while incarcerated but may need to register upon release.

Does an 18 year old transman who underwent a legal sex change have to enlist in the Selective Services?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT

Yes, an 18-year-old transman (an individual assigned female at birth who identifies and legally transitioned to male) is not exempt from registering for the Selective Service.
Key Points:

    Selective Service Requirement: The Selective Service System requires all individuals assigned male at birth to register, regardless of their gender identity. Trans women (assigned male at birth) must register, but trans men (assigned female at birth) are not required to register even if they have legally transitioned to male.

Summary:

An 18-year-old transman, even with a legal sex change, does not have to register for the Selective Service because the system bases registration requirements on the individual's sex assigned at birth, not their current legal or gender identity.

What will happen to the ovaries and eggs of an 18 year old transman on testosterone for the next thirty years (and longer)?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT

The long-term use of testosterone in a transman (assigned female at birth) significantly affects the ovaries and eggs over time. Below is an overview of what might happen to the reproductive system during and after 30 years of testosterone use:
Effects on Ovaries:

    Ovarian Atrophy:
        Testosterone typically leads to ovarian atrophy (shrinkage of the ovaries). Over time, the ovaries may become smaller and less functional.

    Hormonal Changes:
        Testosterone suppresses ovarian function by lowering the production of estrogen and halting ovulation.
        The ovaries stop producing eggs as regularly or altogether, similar to an induced menopausal state.

    Reduced Follicular Reserve:
        The number of viable eggs in the ovaries may decline faster than with natural aging due to suppressed ovarian function.

Effects on Eggs (Oocytes):

    Diminished Egg Quality:
        Long-term suppression of ovarian activity may reduce the quality of remaining eggs.
        Prolonged testosterone exposure may indirectly affect egg health, though the exact mechanisms are not fully understood.

    Fertility Implications:
        Testosterone is not considered a contraceptive, and fertility might still be possible initially. However, after many years, fertility is likely to decrease significantly due to ovarian atrophy and reduced egg reserve.

    Cryopreservation Considerations:
        If a transman wants biological children in the future, storing eggs through cryopreservation (egg freezing) before starting testosterone is often recommended. Prolonged testosterone use can make egg retrieval more difficult or less successful.

Other Long-Term Effects:

    Uterus and Menstrual Suppression:
        Testosterone stops menstruation in most cases, typically within months of starting hormone therapy.
        Over decades, the uterine lining may thin significantly, and the uterus may shrink, leading to potential complications (e.g., increased risk of endometrial atrophy or certain cancers).

    Bone Health Risks:
        Estrogen is critical for bone health. If testosterone levels are not adequately balanced or monitored, low estrogen levels can increase the risk of osteoporosis over time.

    Cancer Risks:
        Long-term testosterone use may increase the risk of certain cancers in residual female reproductive tissues (e.g., ovarian or uterine cancer), though data is limited and conflicting.

Key Points for Long-Term Health:

    Regular Monitoring:
        Transmen on long-term testosterone therapy should have periodic health checks, including pelvic ultrasounds and hormone level monitoring, even if they have undergone hysterectomy or oophorectomy.

    Fertility Planning:
        Discuss fertility preservation early if having biological children in the future is a priority. After 30 years of testosterone, natural fertility is unlikely without intervention.

    Bone and Cardiovascular Health:
        Adequate management of hormone levels and overall health (e.g., bone density monitoring, cardiovascular health assessments) is crucial for long-term well-being.

How does such long-term use of testosterone affect that user's overall health?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT

Long-term use of testosterone in trans men (assigned female at birth) has several potential effects on overall health, both positive and negative. The outcomes depend on individual factors such as age, genetics, baseline health, lifestyle, and proper medical supervision. Here's a breakdown of the effects:
Positive Effects

    Alignment with Gender Identity:
        Testosterone significantly alleviates gender dysphoria for many trans men by inducing masculinizing physical changes (e.g., voice deepening, facial hair growth, fat redistribution).
        Improved mental health, self-esteem, and quality of life are common outcomes when testosterone therapy is well-managed.

    Physical Changes:
        Development of masculine features such as increased muscle mass, reduced body fat in traditionally "feminine" areas, and more defined jawline contribute to greater satisfaction with body image.

    Bone Health (Short-Term):
        Testosterone can help maintain bone density in individuals who might otherwise experience low estrogen-related bone loss.

    Sexual Function:
        Increased libido and clitoral growth (known as clitoromegaly) can enhance sexual satisfaction for some individuals.

Potential Risks and Negative Effects
Cardiovascular Health

    Increased Cardiovascular Risk:
        Long-term testosterone use may elevate blood pressure and increase levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL, "bad cholesterol") while reducing high-density lipoprotein (HDL, "good cholesterol"). These changes can raise the risk of heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular conditions.
        The risk of heart attacks may be slightly higher in individuals on long-term testosterone.

Liver Function

    Liver Strain:
        While injectable and transdermal forms of testosterone have minimal effects on the liver, improper dosing or use of oral testosterone (rarely prescribed) can cause liver damage.

Bone Health (Long-Term):

    Risk of Osteoporosis:
        Prolonged suppression of estrogen without adequate testosterone monitoring may lead to weakened bones, especially after age 50, when bone density naturally declines.

Metabolic Health:

    Weight Changes:
        Increased muscle mass and altered fat distribution can lead to changes in body composition. However, some users may experience weight gain due to lifestyle factors or changes in metabolism.
        Risk of Diabetes:
            Long-term testosterone use may increase insulin resistance, raising the risk of type 2 diabetes.

Mood and Mental Health:

    Mood Swings and Aggression:
        High or fluctuating testosterone levels can contribute to irritability, mood swings, or aggression in some individuals.
        On the flip side, inadequate dosing may lead to fatigue or depressive symptoms.

Cancer Risks:

    Reproductive Tissues:
        Residual ovarian or uterine tissues, if not removed, may have an elevated risk of developing cancer, though research is limited.
        Testosterone itself has not been conclusively linked to increased cancer risk, but careful monitoring is recommended.

Blood and Circulation:

    Polycythemia:
        Testosterone can increase red blood cell production, potentially leading to polycythemia (abnormally high red blood cell count), which can thicken the blood and increase the risk of blood clots, stroke, or heart attack.

Other Considerations

    Skin Health:
        Testosterone can cause acne, especially during the first few years of treatment. Long-term use may lead to persistent or scarring acne if untreated.

    Hair Loss:
        Testosterone may accelerate androgenic alopecia (male-pattern baldness) in individuals genetically predisposed to it.

    Voice Changes:
        Deepened voice due to testosterone is permanent. However, there are no significant risks associated with this change.

    Reproductive Health:
        Prolonged testosterone use typically results in infertility, which may be irreversible over time. Fertility preservation before starting testosterone is often recommended if biological children are a goal.

Managing Long-Term Health

    Regular Monitoring:
        Blood tests: Regular checks for testosterone, cholesterol, liver function, red blood cell count, and glucose levels.
        Bone density scans: Periodically assess for osteoporosis.
        Cardiovascular health assessments: Monitor blood pressure, cholesterol, and heart health.

    Healthy Lifestyle:
        A balanced diet, regular exercise, and avoidance of smoking and excessive alcohol can mitigate many risks.

    Medical Supervision:
        Close coordination with an endocrinologist is essential for adjusting dosages and ensuring hormone levels remain within safe ranges.

Conclusion

While long-term testosterone use can have risks, these are often manageable with proper medical care and healthy lifestyle choices. For many trans men, the benefits of testosterone therapy in aligning physical characteristics with gender identity and improving mental health far outweigh the risks. Regular monitoring and proactive health management are key to maintaining overall well-being.
