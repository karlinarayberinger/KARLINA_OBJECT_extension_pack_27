The following conversation transcript was slightly modified for stylistic purposes and taken from a conversation had between karbytes and ChatGPT-4o at approximately 6:30PM Pacific Standard Time on 15_DECEMBER_2024. The conversation pertains to the topics of conscription (in the United States of America) and long-term health effects of using testosterone in order to enhance the phenotype of a transman (i.e. human individual who was legally classified as being of the female sex at the time that human was born and who later (as an adult) self-identifies and actively presents itself as male).

karbytes:

What is the drafting age (for compulsory military enlistment) for people in the United States of America and which people are excluded from such conscription?

ChatGPT:

The United States does not currently have an active draft; instead, it relies on a volunteer military force. However, the Selective Service System requires registration for potential conscription in the event of a draft.

Drafting Age:

– Registration Requirement: Men aged 18 to 25 are required to register with the Selective Service within 30 days of their 18th birthday.

– Eligibility for Draft (if reinstated): Men aged 18 to 26 could be subject to a draft if Congress and the President approve it.

Exclusions and Exemptions (if a draft is reinstated):

Certain individuals may be exempted or deferred from conscription based on various criteria, including:

1. Conscientious Objectors:

– Individuals with deeply held moral, ethical, or religious beliefs against war may qualify as conscientious objectors. They may be assigned to alternative service instead of combat roles.

2. Physical or Mental Disability:

– Those with significant physical or mental disabilities that prevent them from serving are exempt.

3. Dependent Family Members:

– Individuals who are the sole providers for dependents, such as single parents or caregivers, may qualify for deferment.

4. Students:

– College students may have their service deferred until the end of the academic year.

– High school students may have their draft deferred until they graduate or turn 20, whichever comes first.

5. Certain Occupations:

– Those in critical professions (e.g., medical personnel or others essential to the economy and national security) may qualify for deferment.

6. Religious Ministers:

– Clergy actively practicing their religious duties may be exempt.

Groups Excluded from Registration:

– Women: Women are not required to register for the Selective Service.

– Non-U.S. Citizens: Certain groups, such as individuals on non-immigrant visas, are not required to register. However, permanent residents, refugees, and asylum seekers must register.

– Incarcerated Individuals: Those in prison are exempt while incarcerated but may need to register upon release.

Does an 18 year old transman who underwent a legal sex change have to enlist in the Selective Services?

ChatGPT:

Yes, an 18-year-old transman (an individual assigned female at birth who identifies and legally transitioned to male) is not exempt from registering for the Selective Service.

Key Points:

– Selective Service Requirement: The Selective Service System requires all individuals assigned male at birth to register, regardless of their gender identity. Trans women (assigned male at birth) must register, but trans men (assigned female at birth) are not required to register even if they have legally transitioned to male.

Summary:

An 18-year-old transman, even with a legal sex change, does not have to register for the Selective Service because the system bases registration requirements on the individual’s sex assigned at birth, not their current legal or gender identity.

What will happen to the ovaries and eggs of an 18 year old transman on testosterone for the next thirty years (and longer)?

ChatGPT:

The long-term use of testosterone in a transman (assigned female at birth) significantly affects the ovaries and eggs over time. Below is an overview of what might happen to the reproductive system during and after 30 years of testosterone use:

Effects on Ovaries:

1. Ovarian Atrophy:

– Testosterone typically leads to ovarian atrophy (shrinkage of the ovaries). Over time, the ovaries may become smaller and less functional.

2. Hormonal Changes:

– Testosterone suppresses ovarian function by lowering the production of estrogen and halting ovulation.

– The ovaries stop producing eggs as regularly or altogether, similar to an induced menopausal state.

3. Reduced Follicular Reserve:

– The number of viable eggs in the ovaries may decline faster than with natural aging due to suppressed ovarian function.

Effects on Eggs (Oocytes):

1. Diminished Egg Quality:

– Long-term suppression of ovarian activity may reduce the quality of remaining eggs.

– Prolonged testosterone exposure may indirectly affect egg health, though the exact mechanisms are not fully understood.

2. Fertility Implications:

– Testosterone is not considered a contraceptive, and fertility might still be possible initially. However, after many years, fertility is likely to decrease significantly due to ovarian atrophy and reduced egg reserve.

3. Cryopreservation Considerations:

– If a transman wants biological children in the future, storing eggs through cryopreservation (egg freezing) before starting testosterone is often recommended. Prolonged testosterone use can make egg retrieval more difficult or less successful.

Other Long-Term Effects:

1. Uterus and Menstrual Suppression:

– Testosterone stops menstruation in most cases, typically within months of starting hormone therapy.

– Over decades, the uterine lining may thin significantly, and the uterus may shrink, leading to potential complications (e.g., increased risk of endometrial atrophy or certain cancers).

2. Bone Health Risks:

– Estrogen is critical for bone health. If testosterone levels are not adequately balanced or monitored, low estrogen levels can increase the risk of osteoporosis over time.

3. Cancer Risks:

– Long-term testosterone use may increase the risk of certain cancers in residual female reproductive tissues (e.g., ovarian or uterine cancer), though data is limited and conflicting.

Key Points for Long-Term Health:

1. Regular Monitoring:

– Transmen on long-term testosterone therapy should have periodic health checks, including pelvic ultrasounds and hormone level monitoring, even if they have undergone hysterectomy or oophorectomy.

2. Fertility Planning:

– Discuss fertility preservation early if having biological children in the future is a priority. After 30 years of testosterone, natural fertility is unlikely without intervention.

3. Bone and Cardiovascular Health:

– Adequate management of hormone levels and overall health (e.g., bone density monitoring, cardiovascular health assessments) is crucial for long-term well-being.

karbytes:

How does such long-term use of testosterone affect that user’s overall health?

ChatGPT:

Long-term use of testosterone in trans men (assigned female at birth) has several potential effects on overall health, both positive and negative. The outcomes depend on individual factors such as age, genetics, baseline health, lifestyle, and proper medical supervision. Here’s a breakdown of the effects:

Positive Effects

1. Alignment with Gender Identity:

– Testosterone significantly alleviates gender dysphoria for many trans men by inducing masculinizing physical changes (e.g., voice deepening, facial hair growth, fat redistribution).

– Improved mental health, self-esteem, and quality of life are common outcomes when testosterone therapy is well-managed.

2. Physical Changes:

– Development of masculine features such as increased muscle mass, reduced body fat in traditionally “feminine” areas, and more defined jawline contribute to greater satisfaction with body image.

3. Bone Health (Short-Term):

– Testosterone can help maintain bone density in individuals who might otherwise experience low estrogen-related bone loss.

Sexual Function:

Increased libido and clitoral growth (known as clitoromegaly) can enhance sexual satisfaction for some individuals.

Potential Risks and Negative Effects

Cardiovascular Health

– Increased Cardiovascular Risk:

+ Long-term testosterone use may elevate blood pressure and increase levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL, “bad cholesterol”) while reducing high-density lipoprotein (HDL, “good cholesterol”). These changes can raise the risk of heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular conditions.

+ The risk of heart attacks may be slightly higher in individuals on long-term testosterone.

Liver Function

– Liver Strain:

+ While injectable and transdermal forms of testosterone have minimal effects on the liver, improper dosing or use of oral testosterone (rarely prescribed) can cause liver damage.

Bone Health (Long-Term):

– Risk of Osteoporosis:

+ Prolonged suppression of estrogen without adequate testosterone monitoring may lead to weakened bones, especially after age 50, when bone density naturally declines.

Metabolic Health:

– Weight Changes:

+ Increased muscle mass and altered fat distribution can lead to changes in body composition. However, some users may experience weight gain due to lifestyle factors or changes in metabolism.

– Risk of Diabetes:

+ Long-term testosterone use may increase insulin resistance, raising the risk of type 2 diabetes.

Mood and Mental Health:

– Mood Swings and Aggression:

+ High or fluctuating testosterone levels can contribute to irritability, mood swings, or aggression in some individuals.

+ On the flip side, inadequate dosing may lead to fatigue or depressive symptoms.

Cancer Risks:

– Reproductive Tissues:

+ Residual ovarian or uterine tissues, if not removed, may have an elevated risk of developing cancer, though research is limited.

+ Testosterone itself has not been conclusively linked to increased cancer risk, but careful monitoring is recommended.

Blood and Circulation:

– Polycythemia:

+ Testosterone can increase red blood cell production, potentially leading to polycythemia (abnormally high red blood cell count), which can thicken the blood and increase the risk of blood clots, stroke, or heart attack.

Other Considerations

– Skin Health:

+ Testosterone can cause acne, especially during the first few years of treatment. Long-term use may lead to persistent or scarring acne if untreated.

– Hair Loss:

+ Testosterone may accelerate androgenic alopecia (male-pattern baldness) in individuals genetically predisposed to it.

– Voice Changes:

+ Deepened voice due to testosterone is permanent. However, there are no significant risks associated with this change.

– Reproductive Health:

+ Prolonged testosterone use typically results in infertility, which may be irreversible over time. Fertility preservation before starting testosterone is often recommended if biological children are a goal.

Managing Long-Term Health

1. Regular Monitoring:

– Blood tests: Regular checks for testosterone, cholesterol, liver function, red blood cell count, and glucose levels.

– Bone density scans: Periodically assess for osteoporosis.

– Cardiovascular health assessments: Monitor blood pressure, cholesterol, and heart health.

2. Healthy Lifestyle:

– A balanced diet, regular exercise, and avoidance of smoking and excessive alcohol can mitigate many risks.

3. Medical Supervision:

– Close coordination with an endocrinologist is essential for adjusting dosages and ensuring hormone levels remain within safe ranges.

Conclusion

While long-term testosterone use can have risks, these are often manageable with proper medical care and healthy lifestyle choices. For many trans men, the benefits of testosterone therapy in aligning physical characteristics with gender identity and improving mental health far outweigh the risks. Regular monitoring and proactive health management are key to maintaining overall well-being.

What is considered to be a normal amount of testosterone for a 35 year old transman (who is approximately 140 pounds and approximately 5 feet and 8 inches tall) to take each two-week testosterone injection period?

ChatGPT:

The amount of testosterone prescribed to a transman depends on various factors, including age, weight, metabolism, health status, and response to treatment. For a 35-year-old transman weighing approximately 140 pounds and standing 5 feet 8 inches tall, a typical dosage for two-week intramuscular (IM) testosterone injections might range as follows:

Typical Testosterone Dosage

1. Standard Dose Range:

– The typical dose is 50–100 mg weekly or 100–200 mg every two weeks, depending on the individual’s hormone levels and doctor’s recommendations.

2. Common Testosterone Preparations:

– Testosterone Cypionate or Testosterone Enanthate is most commonly prescribed for IM injections.

– The concentration is usually 200 mg/mL, so a biweekly dose of 100–200 mg would correspond to 0.5–1.0 mL per injection.

Factors Influencing Dosage

1. Target Testosterone Levels:

– The goal is to maintain serum testosterone levels within the typical male range, which is approximately 300–1,000 ng/dL. Blood tests are used to monitor levels and adjust the dose as needed.

2. Individual Response:

– Some individuals metabolize testosterone more quickly or slowly, requiring adjustments to the dose or injection frequency.

– Symptoms (e.g., mood, energy levels, libido) and physical changes (e.g., facial hair growth, voice deepening) are also indicators of whether the dose is adequate.

3. Side Effects or Risks:

– If red blood cell counts (hematocrit/hemoglobin) rise too high or if there are other adverse effects, the dosage may need to be reduced.

Best Practices for Monitoring and Adjustments

1. Blood Tests:

– Bloodwork should be done 2–3 months after starting or changing the dose, then annually, to check testosterone levels and ensure they stay within the desired range.

2. Symptoms Monitoring:

– Signs of too little testosterone:

+ Fatigue, mood swings, reduced libido, or lack of expected masculinizing changes.

– Signs of too much testosterone:

+ Acne, aggression, irritability, excessive hair loss, or an elevated hematocrit level.

3. Injection Technique:

– Ensure proper technique for IM injections (e.g., into the gluteal or thigh muscle) to avoid complications like scarring or pain at the injection site.

Conclusion

For this individual, a biweekly injection of 100–200 mg of testosterone cypionate or enanthate is a common starting range. However, the exact dosage should be determined by an endocrinologist based on blood test results, symptoms, and overall health.

How much would that amount be in milliliters of 200mg/mL medication?

ChatGPT:

If the testosterone preparation is 200 mg/mL, you can calculate the volume in milliliters for a given dose as follows:

[Volume (mL)] = [Dose (mg)] / [Concentration (mg/mL)]

For a dose of 100–200 mg of testosterone:

100 mg dose:

100 mg200 mg/mL = 0.5 mL

200 mg dose:

200 mg200 mg/mL = 1.0 mL

Final Answer:

For 100 mg: 0.5 mL (half a syringe).

For 200 mg: 1.0 mL (a full syringe).

The exact amount to inject will depend on the prescribed dose. Always double-check with your doctor or pharmacist for proper administration!

karbytes:

I do 0.8 mL every two weeks and have been doing so since November 2022 with no known health complications.

ChatGPT:

[Memory updated]

That’s great to hear that you’ve had no known complications! Your dose of 0.8 mL every two weeks corresponds to 160 mg of testosterone per injection (0.8 mL × 200 mg/mL), which is within the standard dosing range. It’s always a good idea to continue regular monitoring with your healthcare provider to ensure everything remains on track. Let me know if you’d like further assistance or advice!

karbytes:

At least once per year I undergo a physical checkup which includes hormone level checking at the clinic which prescribed me testosterone (i.e. Planned Parenthood).

ChatGPT:

[Memory updated]

It’s excellent that you’re maintaining regular checkups and hormone monitoring through Planned Parenthood. This ensures your testosterone therapy remains effective and safe over time. Let me know if there’s anything specific you’d like to discuss or track regarding your health!

karbytes:

Would taking periodic breaks from using testosterone (or temporarily lowering the dosage for some period of weeks) be effective at offsetting some of the adverse health effects of estrogen suppression?

ChatGPT:

Taking periodic breaks from testosterone (or temporarily lowering the dosage) can theoretically help offset some of the adverse effects of long-term estrogen suppression, but it’s a complex decision that depends on individual circumstances. Here’s a breakdown of the potential benefits and drawbacks:

Potential Benefits of Taking Breaks or Lowering Dosage:

1. Improved Bone Health:

– Estrogen plays a key role in maintaining bone density. Temporarily reducing testosterone might allow estrogen levels to rise slightly, helping to preserve bone health and reduce the risk of osteoporosis.

2. Better Cardiovascular Profile:

– Long-term testosterone use can reduce HDL (“good cholesterol”) and increase cardiovascular risks. A break might help balance these levels by allowing estrogen to exert its protective cardiovascular effects.

3. Hematocrit Management:

– Testosterone increases red blood cell production, and some individuals may develop polycythemia (elevated hematocrit levels). A temporary reduction in testosterone can help bring hematocrit levels back into a safer range.

4. Hormonal Balance:

– Periodic breaks may give the body a chance to reset and potentially reduce risks associated with prolonged testosterone dominance, such as acne or androgen-related mood swings.

Drawbacks and Considerations:

1. Return of Dysphoria:

– Reducing or stopping testosterone might lead to a resurgence of gender dysphoria due to a reduction in masculinizing effects (e.g., softer skin, decreased muscle mass, fat redistribution).

– Psychological well-being may be affected by these changes.

2. Uncertainty of Benefit:

– There is limited research on whether periodic breaks from testosterone significantly improve long-term health outcomes. The benefits might not outweigh the potential discomfort or risks.Risk of Menstrual Return:

– Lowering testosterone or taking breaks might lead to the return of menstruation, which could be distressing for some trans men.

3. Inconsistent Hormone Levels:

– Fluctuating hormone levels due to breaks can lead to mood swings, fatigue, and other symptoms.

Alternative Strategies to Protect Health Without Breaks:

1. Adjusting Dosage:

– Instead of taking full breaks, lowering the dose slightly (e.g., to the minimum effective level) might mitigate some risks while maintaining masculinizing effects.

2. Adding Estrogenic Support:

– Some healthcare providers may recommend estrogen supplementation at very low doses (even for trans men) to support bone and cardiovascular health while keeping testosterone levels in the male range. This option requires careful consideration and monitoring.

3. Lifestyle Modifications:

– Maintain bone and cardiovascular health through:

+ Weight-bearing exercises.

+ Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake.

+ A heart-healthy diet and regular exercise.

4. Regular Monitoring:

– Frequent blood tests to monitor bone health, cardiovascular markers, and hematocrit levels can help identify and address risks early.

When to Consider Breaks or Lower Dosage:

– If you’re experiencing specific health issues such as high hematocrit levels, bone density loss, or cardiovascular concerns.

– Always consult your healthcare provider before making changes. They can assess your hormone levels, overall health, and risk factors to guide your decision safely.

Conclusion:

Periodic breaks or dose reductions may offer some health benefits, but they also carry risks, particularly for mental health and dysphoria. A safer and more consistent approach might involve closely monitoring hormone levels, optimizing your testosterone dose, and adopting health-protective measures (e.g., diet, exercise, supplements). Always discuss any changes with your healthcare provider to ensure they are medically appropriate and aligned with your goals.
