The following “plans” each specify a particular frequency at which karbytes voluntarily makes changes to any of its social media profiles (especially in the form of publishing new social media posts which feature karbytes-created content).

PLAN_0: No less often than once per month.

PLAN_1: No less often than once per week.

PLAN_2: Less often than once per month.

If karbytes does not make such social media nor karbytes updates at least once per month, karbytes is implicitly suggesting that (during that period of (relatively) extreme inactivity (in terms of updating karbytes’ public World Wide Web presence)) karbytes is in the midst of experiencing some kind of personal crisis (such as incarceration, hospitalization, kidnapping, incapacitation, or extreme hardship related which incurs substantially disruptive material loss (from theft, vandalism, or economic deprivation)).

Like what is specified on the web page named KARBYTES_CODE_CONTINUES on the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com, karbytes is not considered to be officially done with modifying the body of (public domain and public World Wide Web) intellectual property referred to as karbytes (according to the web page named ABOUT_KARBYTES on the aforementioned website) until and unless that body of intellectual property is not updated (by karbytes (and presumably never any person other than karbytes (i.e. the human-to-cyborg author of this note (which is named journal_31december2024)))) for at least ten consecutive years.

karbytes assumes that it will be adhering to PLAN_0 (which is priorly specified in this note) for the majority of its lifespan (especially while karbytes is employed full-time).

When karbytes is particularly prolific (and has an adequate material and logistical setup which facilitates such creativity and intellectual growth), karbytes expects to adhere to PLAN_1.

If karbytes appears to be adhering to PLAN_2 (which is not what karbytes wants to do and which is, hence, something karbytes intentionally avoids being forced to do), then karbytes is approximately mimicking how karbytes would behave if karbytes (the person) died.

karbytes does not expect to die before the year 2070 (and karbytes is, at least in its imagination, attempting to attain immortality through a hypothetical process described on the aforementioned web page named ABOUT_KARBYTES).
