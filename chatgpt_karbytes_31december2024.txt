The following is a plain-text conversation transcript from a chatbot session established between karbytes and ChatGPT-4o on 28_DECEMBER_2024 at approximately 3:00PM Pacific Standard Time. The conversation pertains to karbytes inquiring about programs to download and run on Ubuntu for burning files to 25 gigabyte M_DISCs (which are a type of blu-ray optical disc). ChatGPT-4o recommended a few open source examples to download, install, and launch via the Unix command line.

Ultimately, karbytes selected Brasero and found success with it (for making test and/or "unofficial" (not considered by karbytes to consist of finalized and public announcement worthy "micro directories") backups of karbytes content close to the end of the year 2024 while still in 2024).

How do I burn files to a 25GB M_DISC on Ubuntu?

ChatGPT:

To burn files to a 25GB M-DISC on Ubuntu, you can use a tool like Brasero (a graphical disc burning application) or the command-line tool growisofs. Here's how you can do it:

Method 1: Using Brasero

Install Brasero (if not already installed):

[bash]

sudo apt update
sudo apt install brasero

Insert the M-DISC: Insert the blank 25GB M-DISC into your Blu-ray burner drive.

Launch Brasero:

    Open Brasero from the applications menu or by running:

        brasero

    Create a Data Project:
        Select "Data Project."
        Drag and drop the files or folders you want to burn onto the project window.

    Start Burning:
        Click the "Burn" button.
        Choose the appropriate disc burner and settings (e.g., speed).
        Confirm to begin the burning process.

Method 2: Using growisofs

If you prefer the command line, use growisofs, which is part of the dvd+rw-tools package.

    Install dvd+rw-tools:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install dvd+rw-tools

Prepare Your Files:

    Place all the files you want to burn into a directory, e.g., /home/user/files_to_burn.

Burn the Files: Use the following command to burn the files to the M-DISC:

growisofs -Z /dev/sr0 -R -J /home/user/files_to_burn

Replace /dev/sr0 with the path to your Blu-ray burner device (use lsblk or dmesg | grep sr to find the correct path).

Explanation of Options:

    -Z: Starts a new session.
    -R: Generates Rock Ridge extensions for better compatibility.
    -J: Adds Joliet extensions for Windows compatibility.

Verify the Burned Disc (Optional): After the burning process completes, you can verify the contents of the disc by mounting it and checking the files:

    sudo mount /dev/sr0 /mnt
    ls /mnt
    sudo umount /mnt

Tips:

    Ensure your Blu-ray burner supports M-DISC burning.
    Use high-quality M-DISCs and a reliable burner to avoid data loss.
    Avoid multitasking during the burn process to reduce the risk of buffer underruns.

karbytes:

Is this for bluray disc burning?

ChatGPT:

Yes, the steps provided are applicable to burning files onto a 25GB M-DISC, which is a Blu-ray format disc specifically designed for long-term archival storage.

Why These Steps Work for M-DISC Blu-ray Burning:

    M-DISC 25GB uses Blu-ray technology and requires a Blu-ray burner capable of writing to M-DISC media.
    Tools like Brasero and growisofs support Blu-ray disc burning, including M-DISCs, as long as your drive and system configuration support it.

Key Points for M-DISC Blu-ray:

    Blu-ray Capable Burner: Ensure your disc drive explicitly supports Blu-ray and M-DISC burning. You can usually check this in the manufacturer's specifications.

    Correct Tools:
        Brasero works for creating data discs, including Blu-ray M-DISCs, using a graphical interface.
        growisofs supports command-line burning for DVDs and Blu-rays, including M-DISC formats.

    Formatting and File System:
        Blu-ray M-DISCs are formatted using UDF (Universal Disk Format), but growisofs automatically handles this for you when burning the data.
        With Brasero, the program also takes care of formatting the disc for use.

    Use Correct Media: Confirm you are using a 25GB M-DISC Blu-ray and not a DVD-based M-DISC, as the process and tools differ slightly for DVD M-DISCs.

Additional Notes:

If your goal is not to burn files onto a Blu-ray disc but to burn an M-DISC that uses DVD technology (e.g., 4.7GB M-DISC), the process will be different and may involve other tools like k3b or dvd+rw-format.

Would you like steps for DVD-based M-DISCs or clarification on any part of the process? Let me know!

karbytes:

I was just making sure it was not for some other application due to the fact that it took a while for the indicator light of my bluray disc drive to turn on during the instance of brasero. It seems to be working now. The light is blinking and the files are apparently being burnt.

ChatGPT:

That makes sense, and I'm glad to hear that the process seems to be moving forward now! It's not unusual for there to be a delay when using tools like Brasero, especially with Blu-ray burners and M-DISCs, as they require time to initialize and verify the media before starting the burn process. The blinking light is a great sign—it indicates that the drive is actively working on burning your files.

Sometimes these delays can be a little unsettling, especially if you're expecting immediate feedback from the software or hardware. It's great that you were patient and gave it time. Burning Blu-rays, especially archival-grade M-DISCs, can be a meticulous process since they're designed for long-term reliability.

If you run into any other quirks or concerns, feel free to reach out. I’ll do my best to help! And congratulations on taking the steps to preserve your data—M-DISCs are a solid choice for safeguarding important files. Let me know how it goes once the process is complete!
